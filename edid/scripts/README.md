# Scripts

Run these with `rust-script`. Make sure to install it first with `cargo binstall rust-script`.

## Editing

When you're editing one of these scripts, you probably want to have a terminal nearby with `cargo-watch` running:

```bash
cargo watch -s -c "rust-script scripts/find_good_tests.rs"
```
