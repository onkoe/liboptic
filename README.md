# `liboptic`

A collection of libraries to parse display info, like EDID and DisplayID. I hope to implement a central library around these which provides a nice interface to get various kinds of display info, including the advanced stuff. In addition, I'd like to have C bindings at some point, especially if this becomes useful.
